# Node.js CSV Processing Script Description

This Node.js script is made to automatically find and process a CSV file in a specified directory, providing insights about the frequency of values in a specified column. Below is a detailed description of the updated script along with comments explaining each part of the code.

## Script Description

### 1. Imports Necessary Modules
- The script imports the `fs` (File System) module to handle file operations, the `csv-parser` package for parsing CSV files, and the `path` module for handling file paths.

### 2. Directory and Column Specification
- The `directoryPath` variable should be set to the directory containing the CSV file.
- The `columnName` variable should be the name of the column in the CSV file whose values' frequencies you want to analyze.

### 3. Finding CSV Files in Directory
- The script includes a function `findCSVFiles` to find CSV files in the specified directory. It returns a list of CSV files found.

### 4. Handling Multiple or No CSV Files
- The script checks the number of CSV files found in the directory.
- If there is more than one CSV file or none, it outputs an appropriate error message.

### 5. Initializes Variables
- `counts` is an object that will store the frequency of each unique value in the specified column.
- `totalCount` is a counter for the total number of values processed in the specified column.

### 6. Reading and Processing the CSV File
- If exactly one CSV file is found, the script reads it using a stream.
- For each row in the CSV file, it checks if the specified column has a value and updates the count of that value in the `counts` object. It also increments the `totalCount`.

### 7. Error Handling for Invalid CSV Content
- The script includes an error handler for the CSV parsing process. If an error occurs (e.g., invalid CSV format), it outputs an error message.

### 8. Sorting and Outputting Results
- After reading the entire file, the script sorts the values based on their frequency.
- It then outputs each value with its rank (based on frequency), the count of each value, and finally, the total count of values processed.
